# The Play Rules Book (Playtime Constitution)

## Our Main Play Rules (Constitution)

1. **Share With Care** (Equal Access Rights)
   Everyone deserves a chance to play with toys and equipment.

   We speak nicely to everyone and use our polite words.

4. **Keep It Safe** (Safety Regulations)
   We use gentle hands and follow safety rules with all equipment.

   Everyone can ask to join, and we try to include others in our play.
