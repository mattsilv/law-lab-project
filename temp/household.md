# The Family Constitution

## House Rules

1. **Be Safe**
   We keep our bodies calm and careful to avoid getting hurt.

2. **Be Kind**
   We use gentle hands, soft voices, and friendly words with everyone.

3. **Be Helpful**
   We clean up our toys and help with family jobs.

4. **Be Respectful**
   We listen and follow directions from grown-ups.
