## Why We Have These Rules (Constitutional Purpose)

- These rules keep our family happy and safe
- They help everyone know what to expect
- They make our home peaceful and organized
- They teach us how to be good family members
- They help us solve problems together

## How We Handle Disagreements (Dispute Resolution)

When we disagree about rules or have conflicts:

1. First ask: "Is there a rule about this?"

   - If yes, we follow that rule
   - If no, we may need to make a new rule

2. While we figure it out:

   - Everyone gets to share their side calmly
   - We look for fair solutions together
   - Parents have final say in interpreting rules (Supreme Court)

3. Making New Rules:
   - We can suggest new rules for new situations
   - We discuss if the rule is needed
   - We make sure it's fair and helps everyone

## How We Can Change Rules (Amendment Rights)

Everyone in the family can suggest changes to make our home better:

1. Share your idea
2. Tell us how it helps the family
3. Let everyone share their thoughts
4. Try the new idea
5. Decide together if it works
